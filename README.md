# CSS-Conflict-Parser
CSS Conflict Parser parses CSS files and keeps track of which styles are applied to selectors. Written in Python, no external libraries required as of yet. Still in Beta. 

The program is capable of outputting conflicting selectors and styling for those selectors, and outputting a list of files that
do not conflict with each other. 

## Usage
`python CSS-Conflict-Parser.py (filepath)`
* (filepath) specifies the filepath to the CSS files that should be parsed.
